Hello everyone! I am Ziran Liang, now a first-year PhD student in the [Department of Computing](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp/) of [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/), under the supervision of Prof. [Wenqi Fan](https://wenqifan03.github.io/) and Prof. [Qing Li](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csqli/). I obtained my master's degree from [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn), advised by Prof. [Yanghui Rao](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/RaoYanghui) and I received a bachelor's degree from [Central South University](https://www.csu.edu.cn).

<!-- Here is my [CV](https://echochou990919.github.io/files/YiZhou_CV.pdf). -->

<!-- My research background is in bioinformatics and data visualization, devoted to proposing effective and explainable link prediction methods on biomedical interaction graphs.  -->
My primary research interests include **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Embedding Representation Learning**, and **Time Series Forecasting**. I would appreciate any opportunity for relevant collaboration.

<!-- especially towards knowledge representation in real-world scenarios: identifying valuable problems, improving learning methods, and ensuring the insights gained are trustworthy. -->

<!-- ***I am looking for a Ph.D. position in 24 fall***, and here is a [blog](https://echochou990919.github.io/posts/blog-post-1/) introducing my strong self-motivation. It's usually said that "connection is all you need" for the Ph.D. application, and while I currently have few connections with the community of Graph. However, let's look at it positively from the perspective of "Link Prediction", what an exciting process of cold start! I would appreciate any opportunity for collaboration.   -->
